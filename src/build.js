// Node and the browser run the same code. The Node script is now a thin wrapper
// that reads a file and writes one; the browser calls buildGraph() directly on a
// dropped export and never writes anything anywhere.
//
// Two shapes are understood without a flag:
//
//   a headline export   Name / Full headline / Profile URL
//   LinkedIn's own      First Name, Last Name, URL, Company, Position
//
// The second is what Settings -> Get a copy of your data gives you, and it is
// the path to prefer: it is yours by right, needs no session cookie, and cannot
// break when LinkedIn changes an internal endpoint. It carries no headline, so
// one is composed as "Position at Company" — exactly the shape classify.js reads.
